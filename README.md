# Amazon_clone

The "Amazon Clone" faithfully recreates Amazon's core functionalities. The Flutter frontend, Node.js backend, and MongoDB database power the user and admin sides. Admins can manage products, including adding new ones. Users can browse, rate products, add them to their cart, and track their orders. Additionally, a "Deal of the Day" feature provides special offers. Overcoming integration challenges, the app ensures real-time data synchronization, a responsive UI, and security for a scalable, e-commerce experience.
