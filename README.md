# Amazon_clone

The "Amazon Clone" recreated Amazon's core functionalities: product browsing, cart management, and order processing, closely emulating the user experience. Inputs included user interactions (searches, cart actions) and product data from the database, with outputs displaying product info and UI updates. Built using Flutter (frontend), Node.js (backend), and MongoDB (database), integrating these technologies posed integration challenges. Achieving real-time data synchronization and ensuring a responsive, secure, and scalable app were key objectives, addressing e-commerce specific requirements.
